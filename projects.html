          <h2>Raspberry Pi Weather Station</h2>
          <p>This is my first project I made when getting a Raspberry Pi. To get used to the terminal and commands that come with it I made a weather station. This weather station shows a live map of the surrounding area. I used a git clone command in the terminal to get an external library to use. I encountered some issues a long the way however I managed to fix them. One issue that I came across was that I was missing a module meaning that I couldn't start the project. How I solved this was to search the web and found the solution to just check if I has the module. I later discovered that I didn't have the module so therefore I used 'npm install express' this then meant that I could start up the project. Another issue that I came across was that the weather map wouldnt load my position, this was a simple fix as I just restated my project inputted my latitude and longitude and got it to work </p>

          <h2>Twitch Moderation Bot</h2>
          <p>This was my Twitch Moderation Bot which i coded in JavaScript I coded this as a demo for a Twitch Streamer to see what they would think to a bot moderator over a human moderator. How I coded this was, I first thing I did was to create a application on the Twitch developer portal. I then created my project in vscode, the next thing I did was open a windows powershell, navigate to the folder to where the project is then type npm innit. This creates a .json file with the bots name, description, version, etc. I then downloaded yarn into my project using npm yarn. I used this to add esm then loaded this in my index file. I then added another file where I would do all the bots features, first of all I added console.log('test'). This command outputed the work test if everything worked properly which it did. I added tmi.js next. What this is, is a package that allows the bot to communicate with Twitch, I went on the documentation and copied and pasted the code to get it started as this ensures that it is setup correct. I then added tmi.js to my .json file with yarn (yarn add tmi.js). I then decided to get the OAuth token which allows my to connect to twitch. Using a url and changing parameters I got my OAuth token. I then inputted this into my code. I again typed yarn start to see if this worked which it did. I then went onto programming in my features. I will happily explain these features if i possibly get a interview with your company. </p>

            <h2>Ethereum Crypto Miners</h2>
            <p>These are my cryptocurrency miners which at the time of typing this they are mining Ethereum. I bought these miners intially to get into crypto mining as I didn't have any experience in this field at the time. However, now I understand more about the Blockchain and crypto mining I am undertaking the task of building my own crypro miner. This miner is going to be/is a AMD miner rather a NVIDIA like my other miners. For this I had to research what parts would be compatible as well as what graphics card has a good hashrate for its power consumption, I then researched about overclocking to try and squeeze abit more hashrate out the cards. This proved to be challenging as many people have different opinions on different cards, eventually I found a card called the RX 5700 Xt </p>
